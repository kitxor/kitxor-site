<h1>Collaborative Filtering at Scale</h1>

<p><em>Building recommendation systems for sparse data environments with city-specific personalization</em></p>

<div class="nav">

</div>

<p>Building recommendation systems for high-consideration purchases presents unique challenges: users interact infrequently, booking patterns are sparse, and traditional collaborative filtering approaches struggle with limited signal. Yet users expect personalized, relevant results when browsing hundreds to thousands of available options.</p>

<p>This is the technical story of a recommendation engine that optimized click-through rates across city-specific models, using collaborative filtering with embeddings to extract meaningful patterns from sparse user behavior data.</p>

<h2>The Sparse Data Challenge</h2>

<p>Unlike Netflix (where users consume many movies) or Amazon (frequent purchases), car-sharing represents a low-frequency, high-consideration domain. Most users book vehicles only occasionally, creating a classic sparse data problem for recommendation systems.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Core Challenge:</strong> Generate personalized recommendations for 200-1000 cars per city when most users have minimal direct booking history, requiring inference from weak signals like clicks, search patterns, and demographic attributes.
</div>

<p>The system optimized for click-through rate as the primary metric, operating under the principle that relevance drives engagement, which ultimately leads to bookings and revenue.</p>

<p><strong>Scale and Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200-1000 cars per city</strong> available for recommendation at any time</li>
<li><strong>Low booking frequency</strong> among users, creating sparse interaction matrices</li>
<li><strong>High consideration purchases</strong> where users research extensively before booking</li>
<li><strong>Geographic diversity</strong> requiring city-specific recommendation strategies</li>
<li><strong>Real-time serving</strong> requirements for search page personalization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Multi-City Architecture Strategy</h2>

<p>Geographic context fundamentally shapes user preferences and inventory characteristics. Rather than building a single global model, the system employs city-specific recommendation models that account for local market dynamics.</p>

<h3>City-Specific Model Rationale</h3>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Key Insight:</strong> "Hyderabad is polar opposite of Delhi" - Different cities exhibit distinct user behaviors, vehicle types, pricing patterns, and usage contexts that require tailored recommendation strategies.
</div>

<p>City-specific models capture local patterns that global models would average away:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vehicle Mix Differences:</strong> Luxury car availability and preferences vary significantly between cities</li>
<li><strong>Usage Patterns:</strong> Business travel vs leisure usage patterns differ by city</li>
<li><strong>Price Sensitivity:</strong> Economic demographics drive different price tolerance levels</li>
<li><strong>Geographic Constraints:</strong> Traffic patterns and distance considerations affect vehicle selection</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">City-Specific Routing Algorithm:
1. Extract user location from search context
2. Route to appropriate city-specific model (Delhi/Mumbai/Bangalore/Hyderabad/Pune)
3. Apply city-specific recommendation logic
4. Return personalized results for local market dynamics</div>

<h2>Segment-Based Collaborative Filtering</h2>

<p>Traditional collaborative filtering relies on sufficient user-item interactions. With sparse booking data, the system employs segment-based collaborative filtering that groups users with similar characteristics to amplify weak signals.</p>

<h3>User Segmentation Strategy</h3>

<p>User segments form the foundation for both cold-start handling and collaborative filtering enhancement. Segmentation operates hierarchically within each city:</p>

<p><strong>Primary Segmentation Dimensions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Booking Duration Preference:</strong> Long-duration (multi-day) vs short-duration (hourly) users</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Patterns:</strong> Search timing, booking start time preferences</li>
<li><strong>Acquisition Channel:</strong> Organic, referral, paid acquisition with different behavior patterns</li>
<li><strong>User Experience Level:</strong> First-time vs repeat users with varying platform familiarity</li>
<li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Age groups (when available) correlating with vehicle preferences</li>
<li><strong>Booking Advance Time:</strong> Planners vs last-minute bookers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cold Start Solution</h3>

<p>New users present an immediate recommendation challenge. The segment-based approach provides an elegant cold-start solution:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Cold Start Process:</strong> New user arrives → Immediate segment assignment based on initial search parameters → Leverage segment-average preferences for initial recommendations → Gradually personalize as user interaction data accumulates.
</div>

<div class="code">Segmentation Algorithm:
1. Extract features: duration preference, temporal patterns, acquisition channel
2. Classify user into primary segments using decision tree logic
3. Assign composite segment ID combining multiple dimensions
4. For new users: use segment-average preferences as baseline
5. Gradually learn individual preferences through interaction feedback</div>

<h2>Collaborative Filtering with Embeddings</h2>

<p>The core recommendation algorithm employs collaborative filtering enhanced with embedding techniques to handle sparse data effectively.</p>

<h3>User-Item Interaction Matrix</h3>

<p>Given the sparse booking data, the system constructs interaction matrices using multiple signal types with different weights:</p>

<div class="code">Interaction Matrix Construction:
• Bookings: Weight = 10.0 (strongest signal, actual conversions)
• Clicks: Weight = 1.0 (abundant but weaker signal)  
• Extended Views: Weight = 2.0 (engaged browsing behavior)
• Filter Applications: Weight = 1.5 (preference indicators)

Final Matrix: Sparse representation of weighted user-vehicle interactions</div>

<h3>Embedding Architecture</h3>

<p>The system learns dense vector representations for users and vehicles that capture latent preference patterns despite sparse interactions:</p>

<div class="code">Embedding Learning Process:
1. Initialize user embeddings (128-dimensional vectors)
2. Initialize vehicle embeddings (128-dimensional vectors)  
3. Learn representations through matrix factorization
4. Optimize for weighted interaction prediction
5. Include bias terms for popularity adjustments

Prediction: Interaction_Score = dot(user_vector, vehicle_vector) + biases</div>

<h2>Multi-Signal Feature Engineering</h2>

<p>Beyond collaborative filtering, the system incorporates rich contextual features to enhance recommendation quality and handle edge cases where collaborative signals are insufficient.</p>

<h3>Signal Types and Weighting</h3>

<p><strong>User Behavior Signals:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click Patterns:</strong> Which vehicles users click reveals preferences even without bookings</li>
<li><strong>Time Spent:</strong> Duration on vehicle detail pages indicates interest level</li>
<li><strong>Scroll Behavior:</strong> How far users scroll through search results shows engagement</li>
<li><strong>Filter Usage:</strong> Price range, car type, and feature filters reveal preferences</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Booking Parameter Analysis:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Price Range Preferences:</strong> Historical price tolerance and budget constraints</li>
<li><strong>Duration Patterns:</strong> Preference for hourly vs daily vs multi-day bookings</li>
<li><strong>Car Type Evolution:</strong> How vehicle preferences change over time</li>
<li><strong>Advance Booking Behavior:</strong> Planning horizon and spontaneity patterns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Contextual Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time of Day:</strong> Morning vs evening searches reveal different use cases</li>
<li><strong>Day of Week:</strong> Weekday vs weekend patterns indicate business vs leisure usage</li>
<li><strong>Advance Booking Time:</strong> Last-minute vs planned bookings require different inventory</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal Patterns:</strong> Holiday and festival periods affect vehicle preferences</li>
</ul>

<div class="code">Feature Engineering Pipeline:
1. Historical Behavior → Extract price preferences, duration patterns, car type affinity
2. Current Session → Analyze scroll depth, time spent, filter usage, search refinements  
3. Contextual Data → Time of day, day of week, booking timing, seasonal factors
4. Geographic Data → User location, vehicle proximity, area type matching
5. Composite Features → Combine multiple signals into recommendation scores</div>

<h2>Geographic and Temporal Personalization</h2>

<p>Effective recommendations must account for both geographic and temporal context that significantly influence user preferences and vehicle availability.</p>

<h3>Geographic Personalization</h3>

<p>Beyond city-specific models, the system incorporates fine-grained geographic personalization:</p>

<div class="code">Geographic Personalization Algorithm:
1. Distance-based scoring: Penalize vehicles far from user location
2. Area type matching: Business district users prefer business area vehicles
3. Traffic accessibility: Factor in traffic patterns and commute convenience  
4. Neighborhood preferences: Match user area type with vehicle location type</div>

<h3>Temporal Personalization</h3>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Temporal Patterns:</strong> Weekday morning searches often indicate business travel (sedan preference, airport proximity), while weekend evening searches suggest leisure activities (larger vehicles, entertainment areas).
</div>

<div class="code">Temporal Personalization Logic:
• Business Hours + Weekday → Boost sedans/luxury vehicles
• Evening + Weekend → Boost SUVs/family vehicles  
• Peak Demand Periods → Prioritize high-availability vehicles
• Holiday Seasons → Apply seasonal preference adjustments</div>

<h2>Batch Processing Architecture</h2>

<p>Given the low-frequency nature of bookings and the high computational cost of model training, the system employs a batch processing architecture with strategic refresh cycles.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Architectural Decision:</strong> Batch processing over real-time model updates. For high-consideration purchases with low booking frequency, real-time model updates provide minimal benefit while adding significant computational overhead.
</div>

<h3>Model Refresh Strategy</h3>

<p>The system balances model freshness with computational efficiency through strategic refresh cycles:</p>

<div class="code">Model Refresh Schedule:
• Collaborative Filtering Models: Weekly full retrain
• User Segmentation: Monthly refresh  
• City-specific Models: Bi-weekly updates
• Feature Weights: Daily adjustments

Trigger Conditions:
• Time-based: Regular scheduled updates
• Performance-based: When metrics drop below thresholds
• Data-based: When significant new interaction volume accumulated</div>

<h2>A/B Testing and Evaluation</h2>
